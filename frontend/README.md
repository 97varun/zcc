The frontend is implemented using React and Bootstrap.

There are a few components that are used in the frontend:
- [Tickets](./src/components/Tickets.jsx) that displays the tickets on the UI.
- [Pagination](./src/components/Pagination.jsx) that enables navigation between pages.
- [Navbar](./src/components/Navbar.jsx) that shows the brand on top.

There are also few unit test for these components.
- [Tickets.test.jsx](./src/test/Tickets.test.jsx)
- [Pagination.test.jsx](./src/test/Pagination.test.jsx)
- [Navbar.test.jsx](./src/test/Navbar.test.jsx)
