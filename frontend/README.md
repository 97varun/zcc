The frontend is implemented using React and Bootstrap.

There are a few components that are used in the frontend:
- [Tickets](./src/Tickets.js) that displays the tickets on the UI.
- [Pagination](./src/Pagination.js) that enables navigation between pages.
- [Navbar](./src/Navbar.js) that shows the brand on top.

There are also few unit test for these components.
- [Tickets.test.js](./src/Tickets.test.js)
- [Pagination.test.js](./src/Pagination.test.js)
- [Navbar.test.js](./src/Navbar.test.js)
